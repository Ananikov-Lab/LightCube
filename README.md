# Lightcube
Photoreactor with control of reagents addition.

First layer contains 4 30W LEDs in 3D-printed matrix.

Second layer is a bath. Peristaltic pump creates flow of water with constant temperature. Glass bottom of the middle layer is transparent for visible light.

Polycarbonate is stable in wide temperature range (up to 120 C), which is the best choice for bottom and middle layer.

Third layer is a matrix with syringe pumps. Syringe pumps are programmable through Arduino UNO and have LCD user menu, controllable by encoder.
