# LightCube
Photoreactor with control of reagents addition.

First layer contains 4 30W LEDs in 3D-printed matrix.

Second layer is a bath. Peristaltic pump creates flow of water (mineral oil) with constant temperature. Glass bottom of the middle layer is transparent for visible light.

Polycarbonate is stable in wide temperature range (up to 120 C), which is the best material for printing bottom and middle layers. Reaction vessels of different volumes can be used for maintenance of photocatalytic reactions.

Third layer is a matrix with syringe pumps. Syringe pumps are programmable through Arduino UNO and have LCD user menu, controllable by encoder.
